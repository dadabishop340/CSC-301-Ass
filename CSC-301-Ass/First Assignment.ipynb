    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Complexity**\n",
    "#####   - **Primitive Data Types:** Simple and straightforward.  \n",
    "#####   - **ADTs:** More complex, can involve multiple operations and internal structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Operations**\n",
    "#####   - **Primitive Data Types:** Standard operations like addition, subtraction, comparison.  \n",
    "#####   - **ADTs:** Operations are defined by the ADT (e.g., push/pop for a Stack, enqueue/dequeue for a Queue).\n",

    "#### 4. **Implementation**\n",
    "#####   - **Primitive Data Types:** Directly supported by the language and hardware.  \n",

    "#####   - Memory is allocated **contiguously**, so the space must be reserved in advance.\n",
